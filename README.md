The goal of the Fake News Challenge is to explore how machine learning and natural language processing might be leveraged to combat the fake news problem.

For Fake News Challenge Stage 1 (FNC-1), we have chosen the task of estimating the stance of a body text from a news article relative to a headline. Specifically, the body text may agree, disagree, discuss or be unrelated to the headline.

In this project, we have implemented long short-term memory networks(LSTM) with concepts of attention and feed forward neural network combined by tf-idf algorithm.
